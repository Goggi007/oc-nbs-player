# DRONE README

All files in this folder reference `nocf.rph.space` as the webserver. This is intended as this is where I host those files. If you wish to run your own instance, please change those occurences.

# What to flash?

Flash the `bios.lua` file. Put the rest on some webserver. Change the bios to load from an appropriate server not mine
